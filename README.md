# 🍽️ Restaurant Finder for Couples

This is a little web app that helps couples decide where to eat.  
It works kind of like Tinder — you swipe (or click) through restaurants, like the ones you’re into, and then compare with your partner to see where you both match.

## Features
- Find **restaurants near you** using OpenStreetMap  
- Set a **radius** and number of suggestions  
- Swipe left/right (or use buttons/arrow keys) to pass or like  
- See your liked places at the end of a round  
- Copy your likes as JSON and **compare overlaps** with your partner  
- Save your settings in local storage so they’re there next time

## How to use
1. Open the app in your browser (no install needed).  
2. Enter your location (or click *Use my location*).  
3. Pick how many restaurants you want to see and your search radius.  
4. Click *Fetch nearby restaurants* or use the demo list.  
5. Start swiping ❤️ / ❌.  
6. At the end, see your likes and share them with your partner.
